Assigned Project :
Do exploratory data analysis on the data. Use regression techniques
to predict the salary of baseball player. Use lasso technique also
and compare the results.

Steps to run the program: 
1. Please run the python file using appropriate command, python lasso.py 
2. At the end of the file, two functions are given : lassoRegression(X,y,testSize) and ridgeRegression(X,y,testSize) where arguments are X - multiple variables,
y - output (salaries), testSize = fraction of test sample needed. Both X,y are standardized data.
3. Code will run automatically these functions, you can edit the arguments if needed. 
4. Three figures will be produced by the code, i.e. alpha - ridge, alpha - lasso, heatmap of data.
